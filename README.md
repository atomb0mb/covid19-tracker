# Covid19-Tracker 
A React JS application that tracks COVID-19 Status. Visit https://atomb0mb.github.io/covid19-tracker/


## Project Description

Watching the news about Covid-19 daily, the numbers and data gets everyone's attention. The data can tell us that the virus is spreading quickly through the specific region or entire world. What can we, as developers, do to make the situation better? We can help to spread awareness by visualizing the data. 

## Technology

* [React](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
* [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/)
* [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/)
* [mathdroid api](https://github.com/mathdroid/covid-19-api)

## Scope

The project is going to fetch the live data from the API using Async/Await syntax. The data is fetched from the API and it will create cards displaying the statistics as well as Charts

## Deliverables

* The initial state of the data display is total number around the world.
* User can view number of cases of Covid-19 for infected, recovered, deaths.
* User may select desired country to display the result.
* User may filter by check/uncheck infected and/or deaths display for chart.
* The selected country will display in bar view.
* Due to API constraints, some data might not be able to display in real-time. E.g recovered cases data display for initial chart view.


## Guildlines to set up the project

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
